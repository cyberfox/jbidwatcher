Beeps on a regular interval when auctions are getting close.

Uncreated Configuration Panes

		Primary JBidwatcher password

				program if the internal HTTP server is running.

Keyboard navigation of the entire program.

Documentation!

Cool ideas
----------
Multiple snipes @ different times, either on different auctions or the
same auction.  (A general 'snipe queue', with a default, but keep each
snipe customizable?)

30 day sliding expenditure limit (percentage of limit allowed per auction?)
(Base limits on max bids.)

Instant Pay by PayPal (Right Click -> Pay Now!)

Add more 'Auction Management' features

Send email to (Bidder | Seller) for won/sold auctions.

Make more JBidwatcher Screenshots

Instant Messager messages on snipe results.

Keys: Delete should tie to Auction | Delete.
Keys: Insert should tie to Auction | Add
Keys: CTRL-PageUp/PageDown might go to Next/Prev tab

Paid-status Icons & more.

Q: What's up with Opera?  (A: It doesn't work with JBidwatcher?)

Send Auction List to other computer.  (Maybe through My JBidwatcher!)

Allow searching through the saved HTML files, including the descriptions?


Code cleanups
-------------
Structural and architectural commentary.

Break up AuctionInfo into AuctionInfo values, and AuctionInfoStorage.

Break debugging out of JConfig?  (For dependency reasons.)

AuctionsManager should be a listener for an 'AddAuction' event, to break UI dep.

Abstract the idea of an AuctionList?  (Same reason, create a 'GUIAuctionList')


Crazy stuff
-----------
Calculated bid (starts with high bid, adds an increment, bids, repeat
until (1) winning, or (2) current high bidder's bid has been found).

    THIS CAN BE VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE!

Calculated snipe (just like Calculated Bid, but done automatically,
and close to the end of the auction).

    THIS ALSO CAN BE VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE!
