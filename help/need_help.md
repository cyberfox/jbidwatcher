I work hard to make JBidwatcher useful. If it has been, and you are in a position to help, it would mean a lot to me and my family.

Here are the answers to a few questions you may have:

## Why are you asking for money?

I've been unemployed since October. I have been looking for work, but I have reached the end of my buffer.  Things are getting better, but it's still a very tight job market, and I'm having trouble balancing bills, mortgage, and supporting my family.

I know it's an uncomfortable thing to do, and it's not a request I make lightly, but it's a dire need.

## Couldn't you just sell JBidwatcher?

JBidwatcher is free software, and I see it remaining that way.  You have treated me well over the last dozen years, and switching to a for-pay-only model seems a poor repayment.  That said, I am definitely looking into ways to provide additional features that are worthy of being paid for.

One approach would be to provide a premium sniping service, for people who don't want to worry about their computers going to sleep, or the program running when it's time for a snipe.  JBidwatcher would, of course, continue to be capable of sniping directly, but in addition you could have my service act as a 'backup snipe' in case something went wrong on your computer.  The premium approach is especially tempting because I'd love to provide a mobile sniping tool.  If I do, it _must_ have a server component, because none of the popular mobile platforms have the capability to consistently snipe in the background.  If I make a premium sniping service, I will definitely provide for folks who help me reach that point.

## Didn't you do this before?

Yes.  In 2009, 3 years ago, I had a similar problem.  I made it through a very bad period with the immense help of JBidwatcher users.  I built back up, extended my financial buffers, and thought I was in a good position to not have to ask for help again.  I was wrong.  Mainly I underestimated the skyrocketing cost of medical insurance for a family.

If you donated in 2009 and don't feel that you got value from it, please take my thanks for your help, and my apologies for not delivering the value you had hoped for.  If you feel JBidwatcher has continued to be useful, though, I'd very much appreciate it again.

## What happens if I don't contribute?

Nothing changes; I'm just asking for help.  I've been building JBidwatcher for a long time, and while it (and eBay) frustrates me sometimes, I still love working on it.  I'm still going to develop it, fix bugs, try to support folks as best as I can, and deliver a great sniping application.

If you can help me get over this hopefully brief hiccup, it would mean a great deal to me.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for any [support](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=cyberfox%40jbidwatcher.com&item_name=JBidwatcher+Software&cn=Personal+message+to+Morgan&no_shipping=1&return=http%3A//www.jbidwatcher.com/donation_thanks.html) you can provide.
